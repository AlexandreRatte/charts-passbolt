This release introduces several fixes and enhancenments reported by
the community.

It introduces the possibility to inject SSL certificates as external
secrets to both the ingress object and to the passbolt container
through the `tls.existingSecret`. By default the chart still relies
on the autogenerated SSL certificate if not specified.

[Deprecation warning]: ingress.tls will be deprecated in future
versions in favour of the new tls{} value to specify secrets.

[Deprecation warning]: ingress.hosts will be deprecated in future
versions too, new values will be announced.
