We are happy to announce the availability of the version 0.5.0 of
the official Passbolt helm chart.
This release comes with a well requested feature: PostgreSQL support.
Users will be able to plug their external PostgreSQL instances or
use the bundled dependency in this chart.
PostgreSQL is an opt-in feature, by default Passbolt helm chart
still relies on MariaDB. However, it should be easy for users to plug
one or the other.
Thanks to all the community members for your feedback and support.

For more information please check our [changelog](https://github.com/passbolt/charts-passbolt/blob/0.5.0/CHANGELOG.md)
